**Hi, welcome !** <img align="right" width="220" height="220" src="/assets/IMG/gemini1.png"> 

My name is Harbaksh Kaur and I'm a UCLA Poltical Science graduate with an interest in ML & AI and neuroscience. This GitHub was created to host my final project for my Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Intro to Machine Learning class! My project uses machine learning to predict carbon emissions and energy consumption patterns over time in the United States.
With my project, I gained important languages and skills like Python, Jupyter Notebook, Matlabplot, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and Pandas.
Those are all showcased in my project.
